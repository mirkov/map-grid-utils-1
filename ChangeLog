	* README.org: Changed nomenclature.  Instead of ``kind''I now use
	``rank'' (as tensor rank) to distinguish between scalars (rank 0),
	vectors (rank 1), and matrices (rank 2)
	Replaced *array-type* with grid's
	*default-grid-type* and *float-type* with grid's
	*default-element-type*

	* map-grid.lisp: The #m macro is causing compilation error:
	"initial contents are NIL".  I use the standard #(...) instead of
	#m(...)

	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp: Changed gref to aref in multiple
	functions

	* map-grid-utils-package-def.lisp: Added call to
	(antik:make-user-package ...) to incorporate shaddowed symbols

	* setup.lisp: Replaced *array-type* with grid's
	*default-grid-type* and *float-type* with grid's
	*default-element-type*
	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp: same as above
	* map-grid.lisp: same as above

	* map-grid-utils.asd (#:map-grid-utils): Changed system dependency
	from gsd to antik.

	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp (pow-curry gcmap): Marked tests for
	deletion since they use obsolete features
