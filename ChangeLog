	* map-grid.lisp: Added export statement

	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp: Added export statement

2012-10-08  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* README.org: Added "Issues" section with one entry: The test
	"mapgrid-man-1" throws an error.  But when it is recompiled
	manually, all tests pass.

	* map-grid-utils.asd (#:map-grid-utils): Removed explicit
	dependency on foreign-array, as it shipps with antik

	* map-grid.lisp (mapg): Fixed bug in destination-specification.  I
	hard-coded an incorrect destination array type.  Now I use
	cl:array for array type, and t for element type.  I removed all
	specializers no CLISP.  All tests are done using CL arrays.

	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp (mapgrid-man-1): Removed specializers
	for clisp in the two assertions that compared the numercial values
	of arrays.  These tests work on sbcl as well.

	* README.org: Fixed *default-grid-type* and *default-element-type*
	documentation.

	* map-grid-utils-package-def.lisp (:map-grid-utils): Removed :grid
	from :use list in package def, as it will be imported via
	antik:make-user-package

	* README.org: Changed nomenclature.  Instead of ``kind''I now use
	``rank'' (as tensor rank) to distinguish between scalars (rank 0),
	vectors (rank 1), and matrices (rank 2)
	Replaced *array-type* with grid's
	*default-grid-type* and *float-type* with grid's
	*default-element-type*

	* map-grid.lisp: The #m macro is causing compilation error:
	"initial contents are NIL".  I use the standard #(...) instead of
	#m(...)

	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp: Changed gref to aref in multiple
	functions

	* map-grid-utils-package-def.lisp: Added call to
	(antik:make-user-package ...) to incorporate shaddowed symbols

	* setup.lisp: Replaced *array-type* with grid's
	*default-grid-type* and *float-type* with grid's
	*default-element-type*
	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp: same as above
	* map-grid.lisp: same as above

	* map-grid-utils.asd (#:map-grid-utils): Changed system dependency
	from gsd to antik.

	* map-grid-mixed-args.lisp (pow-curry gcmap): Marked tests for
	deletion since they use obsolete features
